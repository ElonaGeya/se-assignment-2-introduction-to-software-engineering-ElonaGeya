Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is field of tech that deals with how software is operated, developed and maintained. It differs from traditional programming in that traditional programming's primary goal is writing code. While software engineering also focuses on sofware development lifecycle. Simply, software engineering does well when focusing in large and complex projects while traditional programming projects are less complex.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

According to an article by Hannah Clark, an SDLC will differ according to the team and product. However, fundamentally the stages include:
1. Planning and analysis- in this stage, business specifications are gathered, the project's feasibility is evaluated and a framework is designed.
2. Definition of requirements- here, the information gathered in the first stage is converted into requirements that guide the team to developing certain vital documents.
3. Design- with this stage, a blueprint is essentially made and it is accompanied by a prototype.
4. Development- in this stage, the team turns the documentation developed into code that creates the product.
5. Testing- here, the code is run to check for its functionality and quality before it is deployed.
6. Deployement- in this stage, the product created is then shared to the user,
7. Maintenance- in this stage, bugs and errors missed in previous stages or occured after deployment are fixed to create a better user experience.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall is a methodical approach to project management, while agile, true to its name, uses a more flexible approach. 
Their key differences are seen in namely:
1. Roles- in waterfall roles are assigned while agile encourages collaboration.
2. Planning- waterfall follows a linear process while agile's process is continuos and depends on arising matters.
3. Scope- waterfall looks at discouraging changes outside of the scope/ plan while, agile is more adaptable.
Differences between these two approaches are not limited to the above mentioned. Other differences circle around the ridigidity and flexibility of them which has different implications on the project delivery, documentation, communication, testing and speed respectively.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is a system that provides a framework that helps meet client specicific goals. It is important because is ensures and improves the quality and how effective the final product is.
Its process includes:
-Requirements eliciting, which is about getting familiar with details of the project.
-Requirements specification, in this, project requirements are gathered and there is a usage of tools that help add understanding to project goals.
-Verification and validation, ensure that software meets the requirements of the customer and it has the correct function implementation, respectively.
-Requirements management, runs in conjuction to the above mentioned stages as an ongoing process and as a maintanace tool, essentially.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity refers to a division of a software system into different components, this practice helps with minimizing dependencies among the system. It helps to improve maintanability by making debugging, testing, and factoring easier. With scalability it deploys modules on multiple servers, making it that more than person can work on the modules, speeding up the completion process.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing- also known as component testing is done when a component is tested independently to ensure that they are impartial and to be able to analyze how they work.
Intergration testing- unlike unit testing, in this test components are grouped into a system when being tested, this allows verification of these components when integrated.  
System testing- looks at how the integrated systems work on an integrated environment. This is accomplished by checking the components against specified business requirements.
Acceptance testing- seeks to confirm that the test of components against business requirements passes and the software is ready to be deployed.
Reasons why testing is important in software development do not exist in a vaccum, therefore making one not greater to mention than the other. With that, testing ensures the quality of the software produced is up to par, in that the reliability of the function of the sofware increases making sure that user satisfaction is enhanced.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control is described as a system that keeps track of changes made to a file/files.These systems are important because they allow collobarative efforts and because of the tracked modifications is it easy to recover and back up work done. A popular version control system, as introduced and functionilised in this topic, is Git. Falling well into the above description, Git's features are demostrated in how it works in conjuction to its platform Github, amongst other platforms. Another, among many, version control system is Sebversion (SVN). Unlike Git, SVN's tracking abilities are not limited to files but also extend directories as well. 

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

The role of a software project manager is to coordinate and see to it the completion of a software project. This is made possible by them taking on tasks. The tasks include but are not limited to; planning how the project will be brought to completion, supervising the software development team that will be handling the project, making sure that all work is commisioned properly, keeping tabs on progress in order to mitigate possible trouble, and lastly making sure that the completion of the project is done within the bugdet and on schedule. Mainly because of liasoning between many people, the project manager could be faced with not being able properly handle communication issues between the team, how the team exists in its dynamic and track how time is managed, as each member will have a different way they are interpreting time because of individual perception.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintanance is described as the upgrade of software to better its performance, modify its features and get rid of bugs to overall optimize its functionality. 
Software maintance activities include: 
Corrective software which uses the analysis of crash reports to assist in fixing software errors.
Adaptive software which helps software thrive in new enviromnents, ensuring adaptability.
Preventative software forecasts problems and helps come up with solutions before hand.
Perfective software helps look at fuctions that could be improved for a better user experience.
To conculde, maintainnce is an intergral part of the software lifecyle because it ensures user satisfaction, software reliability and effeciency, and the prolonged life of the software.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? 

Ethical issues faced by software engineers include, breaching the privacy of users, using property or work that is not their own without crediting, developing harmful software and dishonesty about presented software. They can ensure that they stick to ethical standards of their work by performing in transaparency, practising accountability, speaking up about unethical conduct and lastly esuring that software is not harmful to users in any way.
